
Hi, I'm Altamish - a Data Scientist working at an agricultural company dealing with crop production. 
Over the years, many farms across the country suffered from great financial losses due to Potato Blight - a fungal disease that affects potato plants.

I've recently developed a Deep learning model to help me quickly identify what type of blight these potato leafs are affected with. 


My dataset consists of:

3 Classes:

Healthy leaves (152 items)
Early Blight (1000 items)
Late Blight (1000 items)
