## Intro
Hi, I'm Altamish - a Data Scientist working at an agricultural company dealing with crop production. 
Over the years, many of our farms across the country suffered from great financial losses due to Potato Blight - a fungal disease that affects potato plants.

There are two types - Early & Late blight. Which are treated differently.

I've recently developed a Deep learning model to help me quickly identify what type of blight these potato leafs are affected with. 
So we could quickly identify and treat the plants with the appropriate fungal spray. 


My dataset consists of:

3 Classes:

Healthy leaves (152 items)
Early Blight (1000 items)
Late Blight (1000 items) 
256 x 256 JPG
